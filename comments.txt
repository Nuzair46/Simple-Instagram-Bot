All you need is love and a cat.
Not all angels have wings. Sometimes they have whiskers.
Thanks fur the memories.
The road to my heart is paved with paw prints.
You're the cat's meow.
Love is a four-legged word.
Anything is paws-ible with a cat by your side.
I love you meow and furever.
Cats are not our whole lives, but they make our lives whole.
You had me at meow.
I want to spend all nine lives together.
Home is where the cat is.
If there are no cats in heaven, I don't want to go.
To me, you are purr-fect.
I'm a smitten kitten.
I love you more than you love catnip.
Looking good, feline better.
I have a cattitude problem.
The more people I meet, the more I love my cat.
Cat hair, don't care.
Yes, I am a crazy cat lady. What's your point?
The cat is in charge, I just pay the rent.
Sorry I'm late. My cat was sitting on me.
All visitors must be approved by the cat.
I cat even.
She came, she purred, she conquered.
Are you kitten me?
Boys? Whatever. Cats? Forever.
